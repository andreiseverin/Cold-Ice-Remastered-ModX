Hi there, and welcome to the HHEV assault suit, version. 666

///HHEV --Heavy Hazardous Environment Suit version .666///


This is the first version, utilizing the Standard HalfLife DM animations, so there might be a few cosmetic problems with intersecting joints, and the like.. I'm currently animating all 120 or something friggin' animations...I will make it available as soon as it is done..

please point the zip file to extract to the drive that Half Life is in, as I have put the proper directory structure into the zip file.. SIERRA/Half-Life/valve/models/player/HHEV


Please let me know if you have any problems, or have any questions regarding the model..


Thanks,
-Fritz the Cat!
